sobre.titulo=Why this page exists
sobre.linha-1=Hello, cyclists!
sobre.linha-2=This is a simple site that uses a formula created by a legendary cyclist, the three-time Tour de France champion, Greg LeMond, which has helped and still helps many people.
sobre.linha-3=I decided to create it around 2010, when a student of mine bought a size 21 frame from an English online store, when the correct size was 16. Fortunately, he told me before it was shipped to Brazil and managed to exchange it, but it wasn't easy.
sobre.linha-4=I have thought about deactivating this site several times, but I always remember that student and the people I've helped. That's why I keep it simple, lightweight, and ad-free.
sobre.linha-5=I have rebuilt the site several times using different technologies as a way to study, but I am not an expert in any of them. I apologize for any instability or bugs. The source code is available on my GitHub, accessible through the "Links" tab.
sobre.linha-6=It is important to emphasize that this is only an initial guide and that a professional bike fit will always be the best option, especially if you feel pain or discomfort while cycling.
sobre.linha-7=Rodrigo Caliman

form.medida-do-braco=Arm Measurement
form.cavalo.help=This is one of the most important measurements to determine the frame size. Stand with your back to a wall and use a book between your legs, as high and snug as possible, to measure the distance from the floor to the top of the book.
form.cavalo.label=Inseam
form.medida-do-cavalo=Inseam Measurement
form.email.help=Enter your e-mail to be able to retrieve your calculation in the future under the "Previous Calculations" menu item.
form.email.label=E-mail
form.esterno.help=This measurement, along with arm length, determines the ideal frame and stem length. Measure from the floor to the V-shaped notch above your breastbone (sternum).
form.esterno.label=Sternum
form.medida-do-esterno=Sternum Measurement
form.importante.nota=* The LeMond method, used here, was created by the three-time Tour de France champion, Greg LeMond.
form.importante.texto=This virtual bike fit uses a simple and proven formula, but it only serves as a starting point. Whenever possible, seek a professional, whether to purchase a new bicycle or to adjust the one you already own. Different bodies can have different feelings with the same equipment. Consult a professional, especially if you continue to feel pain or discomfort after applying the calculated measurements.

# -- About Page --
sobre.linha-1=Hello, cyclists!
sobre.linha-2=This is a simple site that uses a formula created by a legendary cyclist, the three-time Tour de France champion, Greg LeMond, which has helped and still helps many people.
sobre.linha-3=I decided to create it around 2010, when a student of mine bought a size 21 frame from an English online store, when the correct size was 16. Fortunately, he told me before it was shipped to Brazil and managed to exchange it, but it wasn't easy.
sobre.linha-4=I have thought about deactivating this site several times, but I always remember that student and the people I've helped. That's why I keep it simple, lightweight, and ad-free.
sobre.linha-5=I have rebuilt the site several times using different technologies as a way to study, but I am not an expert in any of them. I apologize for any instability or bugs. The source code is available on my GitHub, accessible through the "Links" tab.
sobre.linha-6=It is important to emphasize that this is only an initial guide and that a professional bike fit will always be the best option, especially if you feel pain or discomfort while cycling.
sobre.linha-7=Rodrigo Caliman
